This is a PowerBI project that is only for visualizations.
It is connected to a Web API and to an excel file, and when data is added, removed or deleted it will is one refresh away from being updated. If the Database is updated so does all the charts and visuals to display up to date information.

This was created on the dev branch and then just merged to the main branch. To ensure a secure main branch that is protected. Since it is a document type it does not corrupt that easy.
