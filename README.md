# Project5-35087749

This is a PowerBI project that is only for visualizations.
It is connected to a Web API and to an excel file, and when data is added, removed or deleted it will is one refresh away from being updated. If the Database is updated so does all the charts and visuals to display up to date information.

This was only used in the main branch since it is a document type of project and the was no need to do checks if the updated version will be compatible with the version on the main branch.
